This is a ML model developed using [Advanced House Price Datatast](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).It is a supervised learning Regression problem where I have to predict the SalePrice of a house based on various factors such as GarageQual(Garage Quality),GarageCond(Garage Condition),Utilities,Street etc.There are a total of 79 independent factors i.e. features on which our dependent variable i.e. label depends.


From the very start of the model, I have explained each an every step why a specific is choosen and and how it affects the model.

The highlighting point is the use of Sequenttial Feature Selector.

I have also provided a whimsical wireframe for easy understanding of the model proceedings.
