# Machine_Learning_Program

This is a ML model developed using [Advanced House Price Datatast](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). 

It is a supervised learning Regression problem where I have to predict the SalePrice of a house based on various factors such as GarageQual(Garage Quality), GarageCond (Garage Condition), Utilities, Street etc. There are a total of 79 independent factors i.e. features on which our dependent variable i.e. label depends.


From the very start of the model, I have explained each an every step why a specific is choosen and and how it affects the model.

The highlighting point is the use of Sequenttial Feature Selector.

I am also providing a [whimsical wireframe](https://whimsical.com/assignment-L784xUMrELRDuyzyGkrzcK@3CRerdhrAw8gzUohMn7Fk5zb) for easy understanding of the model proceedings.
